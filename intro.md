## Genre Fiction

Everything is coming together, everything is falling apart. A dirge resonates through the winter air. People move, sleepy, wobblely energetic, funeral procession and the dawn of the new day. Another day for those who live. Disperion is four hundred twenty three persons squared per twenty four hours, mean is 155994 people a day. People go on dying, their influence on their surrounding stops and they slowly seep away, undulations of culture closing above their heads, funeral rites dancing like snowflakes on that fine October morning.

Factory siren sounds. A dirge to freedom.

### All Fiction is Fan Fiction [^1].

Authors regurgiate what they consume. All sorts of cultural artifacts are .. .. .. regrown and rethought, accents weirdly misplaced to accout for personal quirks, preferences, sore points, pet peeves. Language grows opaque and imitative, meanings struggle and break, their parts falling into new, strange arrangements.

I haven't written any fanfiction either, but that seems to be a more approachable form. Because reasons. I see a brige between the sacred art and the lowly entertainment. The above paragraph spells it out.
